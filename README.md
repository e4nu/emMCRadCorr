# emMCRadCorr
This is a package that can be used to add radiative corrections to any MC event generator. It is developed oriented to neutrino event generators running on electron-scattering mode. The package modifies the output of neutrino event generators in NuHEPMC format. It can also be used to modify GENIE gst files.
